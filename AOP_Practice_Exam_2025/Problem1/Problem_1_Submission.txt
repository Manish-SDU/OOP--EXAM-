1.1 General Analysis
This code models a restaurant ordering system where customers can order food items and pay for them using different payment methods.

1.2 Object Oriented Programming
Inheritance is used in the payment methods (Cash, Card) which inherit from IPaymentMethod interface. This allows different payment types to work in the same way but have their own specific implementations of processing payments.

1.3 Properties
The MenuItem class uses properties to control how its data (like Name and Price) can be accessed and modified. The properties have public getters (get) but private setters (private set), meaning anyone can read the values but only the class itself can change them. This protects the data from being changed accidentally from outside the class.

1.4 Design Patterns
The Strategy pattern is used in the payment system. The IPaymentMethod interface acts as the strategy, and concrete classes (Cash, Card) provide different implementations. This lets the restaurant system process payments differently based on the customer's chosen payment method without changing the rest of the code. This makes it easy to add new payment methods in the future.
